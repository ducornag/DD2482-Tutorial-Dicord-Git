# Combining the knowledge

We will now ask you to combine what you have done until now

## Third Exercise

Try to add a command that, with the given arguments, creates a comment on a given PR.

*Hint1: No hint here, it only reuses knowledge you have gained in the previous exercises*  
*Solution: look at solution_3.py, and add the code where the hint comment for exercise 3 is. Don't forget to stop and restart the bot*  

Restart the code: `python3 Bot_public.py`{{execute}}  
Reopen the bot's code: `Bot_public.py`{{open}}
Open the solution: `solution_3.py`{{open}}

## Other possibilities
There are lots of possibilities, and commands can be triggered on a lot of different events: a new person entering the server, or performing a specific action... You can even play with roles in the server thanks to bots, and thus deal with authorisations.
